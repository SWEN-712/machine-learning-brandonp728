Attached is all my code for project 2.

I had many, many issues trying to get this code to run. The tweets I was extracting had new lines in them which caused many, many issues. First, because of the new lines, azure returned some JSON lines with errors because of empty bodies, or tweets would get chopped up because of newlines from one tweet into several. This created problems for the return statement from Azure and made JSON parsing a nightmare. Eventually I had to write the parse_json.py to parse the files as they specifically appeared. This worked, but then pairing them became hard because I had to then determine what were scores for actual tweets and what were scores for empty messages or newlines, or messages cut short by newlines. All in all this was an extremely frustraing experience as databricks was finnicky to work with and I was unable to follow the provided tutorial after a certain point because of the major differences between the tutorial and teh project.
